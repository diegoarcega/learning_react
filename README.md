Learning React/Redux
-----


This repository was created so I could practice ReactJS from scratch and receive feedback on what I can do better while coding with react.

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

open localhost:3000

node
v4.4.5
npm
v3.9.6

> Note: Running a Babel 6.x project using npm 2.x can cause performance problems because of the way npm 2.x installs dependencies. This problem can be eliminated by either switching to npm 3.x or running npm 2.x with the dedupe flag.
