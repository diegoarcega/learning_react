#React/Redux

This repository was created so I could practice ReactJS/Redux/NodeJS from scratch and receive feedback on what I can do better while coding with react.


* Reactjs
* material-ui
* Redux(WIP)
* [Universal - serverside rendering branch](https://github.com/diegoarcega/learning_react/tree/serverside-render)
* MongoDB

#### run
1. npm run install
2. npm run dev
3. open [https://localhost:5000](https://localhost:5000)

#### versions
    node
    v4.4.5
    npm
    v3.9.6

> Note: Running a Babel 6.x project using npm 2.x can cause performance problems because of the way npm 2.x installs dependencies. This problem can be eliminated by either switching to npm 3.x or running npm 2.x with the dedupe flag.
